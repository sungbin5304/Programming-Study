Dependency injection (DI) is a technique widely used in programming and well suited to Android development.

By following the principles of DI, you lay the groundwork for good app architecture.

Implementing dependency injection provides you with the following advantages:

Reusability of code
Ease of testing

What is dependency injection?

Classes often require references to other classes.

For example, a Car class might need a reference to an Engine class.

These required classes are called dependencies, and in this example, the Car class is dependent on having an instance of the Engine class to run.

There is a way for a class to get an object it needs:
 
Have it supplied as a parameter.
The app can provide these dependencies when the class is constructed or pass them into the functions that need each dependency.
In the example above, the Car constructor would receive Engine as a parameter.

This way is a dependency injection!
